**Quick Note makes it easy to jot down notes in the command line, and
keep ideas clear in separate notes**

This project is fully open-source. We appreciate all the help
we can get and are very open to beginners and anyone interested
in helping.

## Community Information
As this project is simply being done in the free time of a few
bored college students, **Quick Note** is not –– and will not ––
progress quickly (oh, the irony) without the help of others. At this
point, **Quick Note** only works for OS X, and even then there are
a number of issues (see [Installation](#Installation)). Bear with
us while we figure this out.

For users without `homebrew`, we hope to have a separate installer
available soon. Still, the project will likely only work for OS X
for the forseeable future. Portability to Linux should not be
that hard to achieve, but Windows is another matter.
