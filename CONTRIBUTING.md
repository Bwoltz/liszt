## General ##

As stated in the README, any and all help
is very much appreciated. Please follow the
below [Style Standards](#Style-Standards)

## Style Standards ##

*These are in no particular order*

- Comment *thoroughly*
- Make sure to error-check liberally (especially on user input)
- Handle edge-cases appropriately
- Use `"""` commenting above function definitions
- Use *single-quotes* for strings 
- Use *tabs*, **not** *spaces*
- Place **two** empty lines between function definitions 

## Git/Github Standards ##

- Generally, try to keep commit messages short, but
descriptive (if in doubt, follow [this](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
and [this](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)). 
- Don't commit/push tiny additions unless absolutely
necessary –– it just clutters the commit history 
- Make branches for larger additions
- Create issues thoroughly (we can't fix
anything if we don't know what to work on)
- Read and contriubte to documentation
