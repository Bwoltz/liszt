keep ideas clear in separate notes**

## Contributing to the Project
For more information, see the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
This project is fully open-source. We appreciate all the help
we can get and are very open to beginners and anyone interested
in helping.

## Community Information
For users without `homebrew`, we hope to have a separate installer
available soon. Still, the project will likely only work for macOS
for the forseeable future. Portability to Linux should not be
that hard to achieve, but Windows is another matter.
