# Liszt 

**Liszt makes it easy to jot down notes in the command line, and
keep ideas clear in separate notes**

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/liszt/badge/?version=latest)](https://liszt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## Installation
In your command line, enter `brew tap scamacho23/liszt` to download the tap of **Liszt**. 
Next, enter `brew install lst`, which should install `lst` on your machine.

## Contributing to the Project
For more information, see the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
This project is fully open-source. We appreciate all the help
we can get and are very open to beginners and anyone interested
in helping.

## Community Information
For users without `homebrew`, we hope to have a separate installer
available soon. Still, the project will likely only work for OS X
for the forseeable future. Portability to Linux should not be
that hard to achieve, but Windows is another matter.
