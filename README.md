## Installation

### Homebrew
In your command line, enter `brew tap liszt-music/liszt` to download the tap of **Liszt**. 
Next, enter `brew install lst`, which should install `lst` on your machine in /usr/local/bin.

### Git Clone
**Liszt** can also be downloaded by running `git clone https://github.com/scamacho23/liszt.git`. 
This will create a directory called `liszt` (or whatever you want to call it) on your computer.
At this point, `cd` into the directory and run `cmake`, then `make`, then `make install`.

### Pkg Installer
