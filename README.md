# Quick Note
Software to save command line arguments as 'memories'

**Quick Note makes it easy to jot down notes in the command line, and
keep clear ideas in separate notes**

In your command line, enter `brew tap scamacho23/quicknote` to get a beta of **Quick Note**

At the moment, you will also need to add an alias to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` (depending on if 
you use bash or zsh) that reads as follows:

`alias remember='python3 path/to/quicknote/in/homebrew $USER'`
